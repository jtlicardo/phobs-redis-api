# .NET Web API

This is a .NET Web API that was developed during an internship with the aim of caching data for prices and availability of accomodation facilities (hotels, camping resorts, etc.) in Redis. The API serves as a middleware between the [Phobs](https://phobs.net/) property information web service and the front-end applications by fetching the availability and pricing data from Phobs in XML format and caching it in Redis for fast retrieval.
